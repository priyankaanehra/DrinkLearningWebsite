## Homework 13 MAIN

### TODO

The main goal of this assignment is to turn in a full version of your final project video and get TA feedback on it

You don’t have to do this for every screen. You should do this for the 4-5 most different screens. This probably includes:

    1. Home screen
    2. One learning screen
    3. One quiz screen
    4. The final quiz feedback screen
    5. (If you have it) A screen that transitions between learning and quiz
    
For each screen, you may show the red and blue annotations on the same slide if they are readable, but you could also separate them into two slides. Please separate the color annotations onto a separate slide.

1. Graphic Design annotations
    - [ ] create presentation with highlighted & explained conceptual groups with a **red circle**
2. Important info 
    - [ ] Most important information should be a **blue underline or box**.
3. Colors 
    - [ ] Please include **base color**, **accent color** (point to multiple places if applicable), **light grey** and **dark grey.**

## Soft turn in of video 

basically a draft of what we will submit for the final

## What to turn in:
* **Group**. A PDF with a list of the responsibilities of each group member. It’s okay if this
deviated from what you planned in the warm up.
* **Group**. A PDF of your slides with the graph design annotation on them.
* **Group**. An 8-10 min video of your soft turn in. Please provide a YouTube Link.
* **Individual**. A PDF that describe what you did for the project this week. A short paragraph or bullet points is fine. Show images if they help.
    * Show a screen shot of a commit you made to the github repo.
